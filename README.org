* Introduction

  This project is an effort to standardize the usage of Tensor Frameworks (TF)
  by defining a common Application programming interface (API).
  One of the main goals is to ease the creation of bindings for diverse
  programming languages. Most TF are written in C++ and make extensive use
  of generic programming through C++ templates. This in turn makes creating
  bindings burdensome.

  This projects aims to define a common API in the C programming language
  which can access most basic functionality of these libraries. We choose
  to focus on C since most programming languages provide a well supported infrastructure
  for interfacing with C data structures.
  This standard strives to be as general as possible, but a trade-off
  must be waged. Therefore, not all features of TF can be made to fit in.

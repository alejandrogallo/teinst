* Main ideas

What should the programmer want from a parallel REPL?

- We want to be able to compile functions at least on one rank as we
  were working with a normal serial REPL.

- It is important to be able to run serial code in order to make
  quick tests while developing.

- It is also important to be able to run parallel code and test it
  serially.

- Whenever we want to run s-expressions in a parallel fashion, we
  should be able to do this trivially.

- If there is an error in some rank other than the root rank,
  it is not realistic to be able to catch it.
